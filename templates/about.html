        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            <p>Welcome to CORAZON, an innovative web platform dedicated to predicting heart disease using advanced machine learning techniques. Our goal is to provide users with a convenient and reliable tool to assess their risk of heart disease based on their medical reports.</p>

            <p>At CORAZON, we understand the significance of early detection and prevention when it comes to heart disease. By leveraging the power of machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, we have developed a robust predictive model that analyzes various health indicators to accurately assess the presence of heart disease.</p>
